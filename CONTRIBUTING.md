# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pi4B Homelab project!

This is primarily a personal homelab project, but improvements, fixes, and suggestions are welcome.

---

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports**: Open an issue describing the problem, your Pi model, OS version, and relevant logs
- **Improvements**: Submit a PR with config improvements, security hardening, or new service additions
- **Documentation**: Fix typos, clarify steps, add examples
- **New stack suggestions**: Open an issue proposing a new self-hosted service addition

## Guidelines

### General
- Keep services ARM64-compatible (works on Raspberry Pi 4B)
- Memory footprint should be reasonable — this runs on 4GB RAM
- All secrets must use environment variables; never hardcode credentials
- Follow existing naming conventions and file structure

### Docker Compose
- Use specific image tags, not `latest` in production configs (but `latest` is acceptable for simplicity in dev)
- Always include `restart: unless-stopped`
- Add health checks where the upstream image supports it
- Use the correct Docker network (proxy, monitoring, apps, smarthome)
- Add Traefik labels for services that need web access

### Documentation
- Update `README.md` if adding a new service to the stack
- Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for network/topology changes
- Add troubleshooting tips to `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for known gotchas

### Scripts
- Use `set -euo pipefail` at the top of all Bash scripts
- Include descriptive comments
- Test on actual Pi hardware if possible

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. This is a learning project — feedback should help, not discourage.
